*"What is Redbrick?"* - this is the age-old query which has plagued the DCU Networking Society for years.
Redbrick
is such a diverse society that a million monkeys working on a million typewriters for a million years might
reproduce the works of Shakespeare, but they'll never come up with a concise explanation as to what Redbrick is.


Simply put, Redbrick is a rather big social society with a slant on computers and technology. We host a plethora
of techy events designed to entertain and educate anyone and everyone, including cinema trips, pub nights and
tutorials and workshops on programming, web design and graphic design. Expect to see the return of the annual
RedBrick Freshers' Ball *(booze! booze! booze!)* and the table quiz; last year, the quiz saw members having prizes
practically thrown at them, with Sega Mega Drives, portable hard drives, Lucky Charms cereal and plenty of spot
prizes being won. We also raffled off a brand new Eee PC laptop.


At the start of 2009, over twenty Brickies went to Finland - birthplace of the Linux kernel - to mess about in
massive technology museums, employ stealth and cunning in a battle to snow each other into our cabins and feast
on reindeer and mead in a Viking restaurant (all while being quite drunk).


Redbrick isn't just about events though; we are lucky enough to own our own servers on which we host the
services used daily by our members: IRC *(Internet Relay Chat - our most popular service, as it's great for
putting off assignments until the last minute, waffling about whatever's on your mind and meeting new
people)*,webspace *(host your own website with massive amounts of storage space)*, forums/message
boards, the photo gallery and your own `@redbrick.dcu.ie` e-mail address. We also have our own [**wiki site**](https://wiki.redbrick.dcu.ie),
where all members can create/edit/~~vandalise~~ pages on whatever you feel like. You can access all of these
services from any computer connected to the Internet.


Networking societies are to be found all over the country, and Redbrick - as part of the Intersocs network - is
often found mingling with other nerds from Trinity, DIT, NUI Maynooth and University of Limerick, both at
Intersocs events and in the IRC channel.


So, if you want to make new friends, talk about anything that's on your mind, or just get twisted because you
have nothing better to do with your time, RedBrick has something to offer you!
